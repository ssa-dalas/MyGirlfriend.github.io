        One of the many things I love about Miah is her wonderful personality.
        The best way to describe her is by saying that she is extremely
        empathetic, selfless, talented, smart, caring, loving, and she's quite
        ethical. Miah has been through so many horrific things so she can
        sympathize with virtually every situation anyone could go through and
        because of her upsetting past she is so understanding and caring towards
        people. She cares so much about her friends and family, she tries her
        best to keep everyone happy. She's always offering to help people and
        giving up stuff for others, she is just the sweetest girl in the whole
        world. She's extremely smart as well. She makes perfect grades in
        school, she aces every exam, she finished all her coursework in
        preparation for college, and got accepted into a college where she will
        pursue a career in videogame development. She has aspirations and goals,
        she dreams of either becoming a developer for videogames or working in
        some type of crimescene investigation. She's a genius and she
        understands so many things. I just love how ethical she is compared to
        most people in modern society. She's great and almost everything about
        her makes sense. She tries her best at everything and it's always far
        more than enough. She's so perfect in every way that matters. It doesn't
        make much sense that she would be so attached to me but I love it.<br />She's
        my perfect girlfriend&lt;3.
